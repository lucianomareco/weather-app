# weather-app
### Simple weather application created with react

TThe application is based on the request to two APIS  (<a href="https://restcountries.eu/">RestCountries</a> and <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a>). The first API is to request the country of the capital and the second API is to request the climate of the capital of the country.
